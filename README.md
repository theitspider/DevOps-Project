I created a web server on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host a company's website and application, ensuring a robust and scalable environment. I launched an EC2 instance, installed Apache/Nginx, and deployed the web content. To maintain server security and performance, I developed scripts for automated updates and used monitoring tools for alerts. Managing dependencies was streamlined with package managers and version control. I utilized Docker for containerization, creating Dockerfiles and using Docker Compose for multi-container applications, and integrated these with CI/CD pipelines for seamless deployment. This setup guarantees reliability, security, and ease of management.
